# Current issues

## tpm2-tools incompatibility with tty devices

tpm2-tools are not compatible with the current tpm implementation, which uses
USB CDC, `/dev/tty*` device as a communication interface.

This issue is probably caused, by the lack of `poll` function implementation
is `tty` kernel driver.
Apparently, tpm_tools expects a slightly different behavior and are designed to
work with a particular tpm driver

The actual line of code in `tpm-tss` library, causing failures in communication.

```

[Scripts](https://github.com/lpn-plant/ms-tpm-20-ref/tree/cmd_parsing/Samples/Nucleo-TPM/scripts)
are provided to make it easier to debug and investigate the behavior both for
`tpm2-tools` and `tpm2-tss` `tpm2-pytss` libraries.

`simulator` - virtual serial port was created to act as a simulated tpm device,
to capture commands, that tpm2-tools are sending. Those commands can be
directly used, using `lpntpn_cmd` script.

`tpm2-pytss_example` - simple startup example using tpm2-pytss library

`tpm2-tts_example` - simple startup example using tpm2-tss library - has to be
compiled with provided Makefile

## Investigate possible security issues

As Jeremy Boone mention @
[slack trusted-computing channel](https://slack.osfw.dev/), we should
investigate possible flaws in NVMem implementation.

## Incoming data reception and decoding

Data sent from VCOM application always get received as full command located in
one incoming buffer. Parsing commands make use of this feature, letting the
application execute only commands, that are received at once.

```C
static int8_t CDC_Receive_FS(uint8_t* Buf, uint32_t *Len)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 6 */
    if(!TpmSignalEvent(Buf, Len))
    {
        return(USBD_FAIL);
    }
...
}
```

## Protocol analysis - early conclusions

Getting STM32 to communicate with
[VCOM](https://github.com/lpn-plant/ms-tpm-20-ref/tree/master/Samples/Nucleo-TPM/VCOM)
application leads us to a current yet not resolved problem.

Right now we are able to execute commands on TPM, but an error occurs when the
host device verifies the response data. Specifically, this line of code causes
an error:

```C
*((unsigned int*)&response[sizeof(unsigned short) + sizeof(unsigned int)]) == 0
```

[VCOM-TPM.cpp:198](https://github.com/lpn-plant/ms-tpm-20-ref/blob/master/Samples/Nucleo-TPM/VCOM/VCOM-TPM/VCOM-TPM.cpp#L198)

For now, it's not clear what the response data of TPM_Startup command should
look like and what each byte of command represents.

Command and response data looks as follows.

```C
unsigned char CmdBuf[12] = {
0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00
};

unsigned char RspBuf[12] = {
0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
};
```

This data is output via ITM trace on port 2.

Correctness of data was verified on both sides of the communication.

Startup command data is hardcoded in VCOM application
[here](https://github.com/lpn-plant/ms-tpm-20-ref/blob/master/Samples/Nucleo-TPM/VCOM/VCOM-TPM/VCOM-TPM.cpp#L192)
what makes it hard to reason about its origins.

Raw data dumped from `CDC_Receive_FS` shows some similarities between VCOM
sent command and test run of `tpm2_startup -T device:/dev/ttyACM1` application.

VCOM Startup command received

```text
0x54 0x70 0x6d 0x32 0x3 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x4 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xac 0x44 0x69 0x61
0x54 0x70 0x6d 0x32 0x6 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x14 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xc 0x0 0x0 0x0 0x80 0x1 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xc 0x0 0x0 0x1 0x44 0x0 0x0
```

tpm2_startup received command

```text
0x80 0x1 0x0 0x0 0x0 0xc 0x0 0x0 0x1 0x44 0x0 0x1
```

As you can see VCOM sends much more bytes. Presumably two commands (?) as new
the line gets appended to the log after a new pack of data gets received by
`CDC_Receive_FS` function.

```C
static int8_t CDC_Receive_FS(uint8_t* Buf, uint32_t *Len)
{
    for(int i=0; i<*Len; i++) {
        itmPrintAppend(ITMSTDERR, "0x%x ", Buf[i]);
    }
    itmPrintAppend(ITMSTDERR, "\n");
...
}
```

What's interesting is the last 12 bytes of the received buffer, which differs
only in the last byte between VCOM and tpm2_startup.

Software simulator [tpm-js](https://google.github.io/tpm-js/) shows exactly the
same command and response data, as ITM debug output when using VCOM application.

tpm-js output:

```text
PowerOn
ManufactureReset
Startup
About to execute command TPM2_CC_Startup
Command buffer (12):
  0000 80 01 00 00 00 0c 00 00 01 44 00 00              .........D..
Response buffer (10):
  0000 80 01 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00 00                    ..........
```

ITM port 2 output:

```C
//2021.10.14-08:52:37.000GMT
unsigned char CmdBuf[12] = {
0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0c, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x44, 0x00, 0x00
};
//2021.10.14-08:52:37.330GMT
unsigned char RspBuf[12] = {
0x80, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0a, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00
};
```

From what I discovered, the first 4 bytes of VCOM communication are the
magic signal values from `TpmDevice.h`

```C
0x54 0x70 0x6d 0x32

#define SIGNALMAGIC (0x326d7054) //Tpm2
```

For now, the rest of the protocol is to be discovered. Probably we should
focus on getting `tpm2_tools` to work with STM32, as we probably don't want to
port VCOM to Linux.

This requires a better understanding of the communication protocol itself thus
the following document will be helpful:

[TCG TSS 2.0 TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) API Specification](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_TSS_TCTI_v1p0_r18_pub.pdf)

20.10.2021 update:

The incoming data sent from VCOM application decodes as follows:

```text
54 70 6d 32 6 0 0 0 14 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 c 0 0 0 80 1 0 0 0 c 0 0 1 44 0 0
```

```C
sizeof(signalWrapper_t)
{
sig->s.magic    '\x54\x70\x6d\x32'	uint32_t hardcoded magic value
sig->s.signal   '\x06\x00\x00\x00'	uint32_t signal enum
sig->s.dataSize '\x14\x00\x00\x00'	uint32_t data size
}
sizeof(unsigned int) * 2)
{
'\x00\x00\x00\x00'			uint32_t locality
'\x0c\x00\x00\x00'			uint32_t cmdSize
}
actual TPM command			Global.h:1098
'\x80\x01' 				TPM_ST           command.tag;
'\x00\x00'\x00\x0c'			UINT32           commandSize;
'\x00\x00\x01\x44'			TPM_CC           command.code
'\x00\x00'
```

Probably all of those header values are redundant and should be decoded using
unmarshal mechanism.

## Memory usage

Memory limitations hit us right at the beginning preventing us from building the
project for STM32L476RG on both Linux STM32CubeIDE and Windows Atollic Studio.

After limiting the minimal stack size in the linker script the application fits
in SRAM memory, but probably the problem will hit us soon after successful
execution of TPM command.

At the moment of writing, we are almost out of memory.

## Outdated repository

After struggling a lot with build errors while compiling the `master` branch we
decided to roll back the repo. Chosen commit is the one, that adds STM32
samples. Plans involve updating the repo, eventually hitting most actual
changes.

## Differences between STM32 and Simulator implementation of command parsing

Dealing with the actual communication with TPM core we are facing some minor
problems.

VCOM application dedicated to TPM communication, located in
`ms-tpm-20-ref/Samples/Nucleo-TPM/VCOM` is created using Windows, so we have to
decide if we want to port it.

Data packet for controlling the TPM differs between one used by `tpm2_tools`,
Simulator, and STM32 implementation.

This point needs additional investigation, but a quick glance at received data
sent by using `tpm2_startup -T device -d/dev/ttyACM1 --state` command ensures us
about it. By /dev/ACM1 port we mean STM32 USB CDC.

## Possible bug in build system

According to the project assumptions, whole configuration is done using
`user_settings.h` file. Previously encountered
[error](https://github.com/lpn-plant/ms-tpm-20-ref/commit/c681b2130df35b0d1ae498656476f30cd4e472e4)
led us to the conclusion that some parts of the aplication could be
misconfigured.

Some of the build switches inside `TpmBuildSwitches.h` could be enabled in an
unwanted way.

It needs to be further investigated with defines like `SIMULATION` and
`SELF_TESTS` in mind. Maybe we can get some extra free RAM space this way.
