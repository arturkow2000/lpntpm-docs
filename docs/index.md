# About

[lpnTPM](https://nlnet.nl/project/lpnTPM/) is Open Source Software (OSS),
and Open Source Hardware (OSHW) Trusted Platform Module (TPM, also known as
ISO/IEC 11889) is an international standard for a secure cryptoprocessor,
a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated
cryptographic keys.

What makes lpnTPM different from generally available solutions is openness.
Software and hardware of lpnTPM can, without limits, be audited, fixed, and
customized by communities and businesses. Open design address the lack of
trustworthiness of proprietary closed source TPM products, which currently
dominate the whole market. lpnTPM in production mode protects software by secure
boot technology, and only the lpnTPM owner will update it. TPM modules enable
measured boot and support verified boot, Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement,
and other security features. Another benefit of lpnTPM would be physical design,
which solves the lack of standardization around pinout and connector.

The ultimate goal of lpnTPM is to provide a trustworthy platform for future open
evolution of Trusted Platform Module software and its application to various
computing devices, resulting in better adoption of platform security.

This project was funded through the NGI Assure Fund, a fund established by NLnet
with financial support from the European Commission's Next Generation Internet
programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology
under grant agreement No 957073.
